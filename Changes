Changelog for VSO

2011-11-28      v0.004
  - Updated SYNOPSIS in POD.
  - Added 'where' checking.
  - For 'where', $_ is localized to the yet-to-be-validated value and $_[0] is the
    object to which the attribute (which is validating the value) belongs.
  - Several tweaks here and there.

2011-11-19      v0.003
  - Value type-checking on constructor now works.
  - 'before' and 'after' attribute modifiers now work.
  - Not yet as fast as I want it to be.
  - Type-checking now works for things like:
    isa => 'ArrayRef[My::Thing]'
    - and -
    isa => 'HashRef[My::Thing]'
  - Type-checking slows things down...a lot.

2011-11-17      v0.002
  - Fixed recursive depency issue.

2011-11-17      v0.001
  - Initial release.
  - God help us.
